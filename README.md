# Ask-Questions-to-Make-Data-Driven-Decisions
Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. In this process, you address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical solution.

## Data analysts work with six basic problem types:
#### making predictions, 
#### categorizing things, 
#### spotting something unusual,
#### identifying themes, 
#### discovering connections
#### finding patterns.

## Effective questions follow the SMART methodology. That means they're: 
#### Specific, 
#### Measurable, 
#### Action-oriented, 
#### Relevant
#### Time-bound

Fairness means ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias.

Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further, grouping them into broader themes.

Data analysis can help us make more informed decisions.

Data-inspired decision-making explores different data sources to find out what they have in common.

An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.

#### Data => Information => Knowledge

Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can often be the what, how many, and how often about a problem.

Qualitative data describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data,
like your hair color. Qualitative data is great for helping us answer why questions.

Two data presentation tools, reports and dashboards. Reports and dashboards are both useful for data visualization.

A report is a static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically.

A dashboard monitors live, incoming data.

A pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables are used to summarize, sort, re-organize, group, count, total, or average data stored in a database.

A metric is a single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement. 

Revenue, is the number of sales multiplied by the sales price. (# of sales x sales price)

ROI, or Return on Investment is essentially a formula designed using metrics that let a business know how well an investment is doing. The ROI is made up of two metrics, the net profit over a period of time and the cost of investment. By comparing these two metrics, profit and cost of investment, the company can analyze the data they have to see how well their investment is doing. 

ROI = Profit / Cost of Investment
where Profit = Current Value of Investment - Cost of Investment

Customer retention rates can help the company compare the number of customers at the beginning and the end of a period to see their retention rates. 

Metric goal is a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics.
