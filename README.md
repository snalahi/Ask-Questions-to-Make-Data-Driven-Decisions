Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options. In this process, you address a vague, complex problem by breaking it down into smaller steps, and then those steps lead you to a logical solution.

#### making predictions, 
#### categorizing things, 
#### spotting something unusual,
#### identifying themes, 
#### discovering connections
#### finding patterns.
